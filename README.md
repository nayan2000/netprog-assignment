# üöÄÔ∏è [ASSIGNMENT - I](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-1)

## [1. Local Shell](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-1/P1) : UNIX Programming : Fork, Processes

We implement a basic bash-like shell with support for job control, process chaining using pipes, input-output redirection, and some custom commands such as double pipes, triple pipes and shortcut mode.[[probem statement](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-1/202_NP_Assignment1_1.pdf)][[design statement](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-1/P1/P1_Design_Document.pdf)]

## [2. Cluster Shell](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-1/P2) : UNIX Programming : TCP Sockets

We implement a cluster shell with support for process chaining using pipes, use of * operator, and cd command.[[probem statement](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-1/202_NP_Assignment1_1.pdf)][[design statement](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-1/P2/P2_Design_Document.pdf)]

## [3. Group Messaging System](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-1/P3) : UNIX Programming : System V Message Queues

We implement a group messaging system using message queues with support for creating, joining and listing groups, sending and receiving  messages to and from private users and groups and auto delete messages.[[probem statement](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-1/202_NP_Assignment1_1.pdf)][[design statement](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-1/P3/P3_Design_Document.pdf)]


# üöÄÔ∏è [ASSIGNMENT - II](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-2)

## [1. Dummy Ping System Utility - RTT](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-2/P1) : UNIX Programming : Raw Sockets

We implement a ping system utility for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, with features of simultaneous RTT calculations for a bulk of IP addresses, using I/O multiplexing.[[probem statement](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-2/202_NP_Assignment2.pdf)][[design statement](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-2/P1/P1_Design_Document.pdf)]

## [2. Preforked Server Model](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-2/P2) : UNIX Programming : Server Models

We implement a preforked server model with dynamic handling of child servers to balance the traffic, with the help of UNIX domain sockets for inter-process communication.[[probem statement](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-2/202_NP_Assignment2.pdf)][[design statement](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-2/P2/P2_Design_Document.pdf)]

## [3. Group Messaging on LAN](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-2/P3) : UNIX Programming : Multicasting, Broadcasting

We implement a P2P group messaging system for LAN users using multicasting and broadasting, with support for creating, joining and listing groups, sending and receiving messages, and filelists.[[probem statement](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-2/202_NP_Assignment2.pdf)][[design statement](https://github.com/nayan2000/netprog-assignment/blob/main/Assignment-2/P3/P3_Design_Document.pdf)]
